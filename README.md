# Mentorship-Robot
Code specifically dealing with my mentorship robot. 
Line sensor code details how the IR sensors process the information from the IR sensors. This code essentially runs the PCB board. We use the function defined here in the main program. 
Main code that: checks battery for safe voltage, cleans up faulty input data, displays important values on an LCD screen, and its primary purpose, drawing out the grid given to the robot.
